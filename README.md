## Abstract
- In recent years, voice assistant has shown significant process  and  its potential is growing. And billions of devices that incorporates them in domestic nowadays. Then, to communicate with one another, Email is one of the most prevalent way.  In this paper,  we are  targeting  to  establish  an  AI  based  email  voice  assistant  system. The voice assistant listens to the user's voice input and converts it as a text and then sends it as an email message to the recipient. Firstly, we have to provide user’s email id and its Gmail account’s password to authenticate and this can be executed using Python in PyCharm community IDE. SMTP is  the most  common  and  popular  protocol  of  email  which  means  Simple  Mail  Transfer  Protocol . It  is used  for  transmitting  email  from  one  account  to  other  over  the  internet. Protocol  means a  list  of  instructions  that  validate  and  manage  the  transfer  of  email   and  also it  pushes the message  from  client  to  the  server.  MTA ( Message Transfer Agents ) is the client  which  should  be present  in  the  system  to  send  and  receive  mail.
